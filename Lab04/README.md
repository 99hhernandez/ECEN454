## INTRODUCTION

In this lab you will be designing the 1-bit adder circuit, which will be then used to form the 4-
bit adder in the next lab. In the following sections, you will be given instructions on how to
perform post-layout simulations which you will need to do on each of the standard cells that
have been designed and then use these standard cells to build the layout of the 1-bit adder. After
this, you will verify its overall performance by performing post-layout simulations on the entire
circuit.
