## INTRODUCTION
After completing the design of a single combinational stage of the design, you will next design the
basic sequential element that will be used in the design, i.e., the Flip-Flop (FF). In this lab you will be
required to design Flip-Flop and also characterize its delay, input capacitance and its setup and hold
time.

## REPORT REQUIREMENTS
1. Schematic, layout, and LVS report of your design of Flip-Flop
2. Report a plot sufficiently verifying the correctness of your design. (CLK, _CLK, falling &
rising of D and Q).
3. Report the rising and falling clock-to-Q delays of the FF in table format with respect to output
loads (10 points from 1fF to 100fF).
4. Report the input capacitance of input D with the plot from AC simulation.
5. Report the ``setup time`` for both the D rising and falling in a delay table format where in the
clock-to-Q delay is measured for varying separations between the D input and the CLK rising
edge. Please clarify how you determine the setup time of your design.
