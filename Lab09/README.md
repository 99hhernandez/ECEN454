## INTRODUCTION
In this lab you have to identify the critical path in your design (4 bit adder), and reduce the
delay of this path by determining the optimal number of devices and sizes of the gates that lie
along this path. You have to use the Logical Effort and Gate sizing techniques you learn in the
course.

## REQUIREMENTS
1) Print out the schematic of your circuit and draw a line along the critical path. Include your
calculations to determine the number of stages in the circuit, the path effort, and the transistor
sizes. You need to clearly show your calculation steps. If you wrote a spice netlist, include a
drawing of the critical path.
2) Turn in the waveforms for the same input vectors given in the lab 5. Make a table
comparing the delays and the VDD Power consumption of both the non-optimized and the
optimized circuits for all cases (you need to calculate improvement). Please switch all inputs at
the same time as you did in the lab 5.
3) Make a table comparing the Area (sum of all the transistorsâ€™ W*L).
