## INTRODUCTION

In this lab session you will be required to characterize the standard cells that you have used in
the design of the pipelined adder so far. Although cell characterization includes a wide number
of parameters such as propagation delay, power, area, timing constraints in the case of
sequential elements, input capacitance and global parameters like PVT(Process, Voltage,
Temperature), corner selection, etc. In this lab you will be dealing only with the propagation
delay and input capacitance of a standard cell by performing circuit simulations at the
transistor level.
