## INTRODUCTION
Design Vision is the graphical interface to the Synopsys family of logic synthesis tools. Internally it runs
design compiler. This lab is to familiarize you with the basics of synthesis using Design Vision through a simple
example "cruise control design". After synthesis, you will do pre-layout static timing analysis of your synthesized
design. You will define constraints for your design and check the timing of all the paths in the design. In the final part
of this lab we will use the synthesized Verilog netlist that you will generate for the cruise control logic to "Place and
Route" the circuit on a die.
