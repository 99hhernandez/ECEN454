# INTRODUCTION

In this lab you will create the physical layout of all the logic gates (Inverter, NAND2, and XOR2) that you
used in the previous labs. This lab manual contains instructions to draw the schematic and layout of a basic
inverter circuit. You will also perform extraction of the layout parameters and verifying if the layout drawn is
equivalent to the schematic (of the corresponding gate) through an LVS (Layout versus schematic) check. You
would have to implement the same for the other required gates. Make sure you have attached the
“NCSU_TechLib_tsmc02” technology file to your library before you begin the lab. This technology will use
design rules based on the 0.2 μm technology from TSMC. This means that the smallest feature size that can be
implemented is 0.2 μm. All the layout dimensions would be in terms of “λ” which is equal to half the feature
size (0.1 pm in this case).
